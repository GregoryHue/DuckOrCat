# DOCDatasetManager

Duck or Cat is a binary classification model. It classifies pictures of ducks and cats. A Scrapy project is available to manage your dataset.

## Project setup

Get into the project folder:
```bash
cd DuckOrCat
```

Create a new environment:

```bash
virtualenv --python="/usr/bin/python3" env
```

Get into that environment:

```bash
source env/bin/activate 
```

Install the librairies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run:

```bash
cd app && scrapy crawl [duck|cat]
```

This will download pictures, depending which website you have put in `app/downloader/spiders/ducks.py` in `allowed_domains` and `start_urls`. You can try with `https://unsplash.com/s/photos/duck`. The pictures will be available in `app/images/`.

Some scripts are available in `app/tools/`:

* ``delete_duplicate.py``: delete every picture duplicates in a folder.
* ``rename.py``: rename every pictures of a folder following a pattern.
* ``resize.py``: to save on storage and RAM, resize every pictures to be maximum 1024 pixels of width and height.

To use any of them :

```bash
cd app/tools/ && python3 [script_name]
```

## Versions

* Python 3.10.6
* Ubuntu 20.04.5
